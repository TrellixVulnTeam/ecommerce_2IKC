# substyle

_substyle_ is a simple helper function for writing reusable React components that are stylable through both, CSS and inline styles. In its core, it is nothing more than a simple mapping of the `style` and `className` prop values:

```javascript
({ style, className }, key) => ({
  className: key ? className && `${className}__${key}` : className,
  style: key ? style && style[key] : style
})
```

## Motivation

First, let's clarify the term _reusable component_. Reuse here does NOT mean components being used in multiple other components inside a single React application, but refers to **reuse across multiple applications**. Thus, reusable components are usually distributed as npm modules. While you can of course include CSS files in npm modules, there is no way of actually coupling reusable components and their stylesheets without making assumptions about the environment. Many libraries make do with using some prefixed class names and pointing users to a CSS file in the readme, however, this has the following problems: It's all too easy to forget about including the CSS (or removing it once the component is not used anymore) and there's always a risk of global class name conflicts.

Eliminating CSS in favor of inline styles can solve these problems as inline style definitions are properly coupled with components and there is no need to deal with global class names. So when distributing React components, ship inline styles instead of stylesheets. However, you have to ensure that users of your components can fully customize their styling. _substyle_ helps you do just that by designating one consistent scheme for both:

- selecting the right parts of the nested inline styles for each rendered child element
- deriving an optional and customizable CSS class name for each rendered child element


## Installation

```
npm install --save substyle
```

## Example

Let's create a reusable `Popover` component using _substyle_:

```javascript
import substyle from 'substyle'

const Popover = (props) => (
  <div {...substyle(props)}>
    <button {...substyle(props, 'close')}>x</button>
    { props.children }
  </div>
)
```

That's it: Our `Popover` component can now be used with CSS as well as with inline styles.

##### For using CSS, assign `className`

```javascript
// JSX                                        // Rendered HTML

<Popover className='popover'>                 // <div class='popover'>
  ...                                         //   <button class="popover__close">x</button>
</Popover>                                    //   ...
                                              // </div>
```

##### For using inline styles, assign `style`

```javascript
// JSX                                        // Rendered HTML
                         
<Popover style={{                             // <div style='background: white;'>
  background: 'white',                        //   <button style="right: 0;">x</button>
  close: { right: 0 }                         //   ...  
}}>                                           // </div>
  ...                                  
</Popover>
```

So what does this achieve? First, it assigns class names derived from the element's `className` prop. If the component is used without a `className`, it's safe to assume that none of the child elements require a class name to be set. Second, if a `style` object is supplied to the element, it selects the nested sub object under the specified key for the child element. By using the same keys for derived class names and nested element style definitions, a consistent naming scheme is established.


## API

## How to use it

_substyle_ picks up the idea of [BEM methodology](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) of breaking style definitions down into **B**lock, **E**lement, and **M**odifier parts. In fact, _substyle_ generates derived class names that follow BEM syntax. You don't have to know anything about BEM other than understanding how the three basic terms relate to React components. And this is straightforward:

- **block**: component
- **element**: descendant element of a component
- **modifier**: represents a specific state or variation of a block or element

#### Block 

A React component's render function always returns exactly one React element. This container element, often a `div`, wraps all descendant elements and represents the component block in the DOM. As such, it is assigned the block name as class name and receives the direct style definitions of the nested inline style object. For deriving the block styles, simply call `substyle(props)` without a second argument.

**Example**

```javascript
const Foo = (props) => <div {...substyle(props)}>...</div>

<Foo className='foo' />                   // <div class='foo'>...</div>

<Foo style={{                             // <div style='position: absolute; top: 0;'>...</div>
    position: 'absolute',                
    top: 0,                               
                                          
    bar: {
      width: '100%'
    }
  }} 
/>
```

#### Elements


For all React elements returned by the component's `render` function other than the root container, `substyle(props, key)` is used with a `key` string as second argument, which identifies the element's type or role within the component. As a result, the corresponding DOM node is assigned a BEM class name of the form `'block__element'` on the one hand, and, on the other hand, receives all nested inline style definitions found under the nested property named `key` of the passed style prop.

**Example**

```javascript
const Foo = (props) => <div {...substyle(props)}>
  <div {...substyle(props, 'bar')} />
  <div {...substyle(props, ['bar', 'baz'])} />
</div>

<Foo className='foo' />                   // <div class='foo'>
                                          //   <div className='foo__bar' />
                                          //   <div className='foo__bar foo__baz' />
                                          // </div>

<Foo style={{                             // <div style='position: absolute; top: 0;'>
    position: 'absolute',                 //   <div style='width: 100%' /> 
    top: 0,                               //   <div style='width: 100%' /> 
                                          // </div> 
    bar: {
      width: '100%'
    }
  }} 
/>
```

As you can see in this example, it's possible to use an array of element keys. In turn, the element receives multiple class names, one derived for each key item. At the same time, nested inlines styles are picked from all properties found for these keys.


#### Modifiers

Modifiers are used to set styles conditionally based on props or state. If used on the container element, a class name of the form `'block block--modifier'` will be set on that node. In addition to the direct inline style definitions, it will receive the style definitions found nested under the `'&modifier'` property. When using CSS, the additional modifier class name on the block container is already sufficient for being able to customize all nested elements according to the modification, as we can simply write selectors such as `.block--modifier .block__element`. However, for supporting customization through inline styles, we have to explicitly set the modifiers in the `substyle` calls for all nested elements as well.

**Example**

```javascript
const Foo = ({ disabled, ...rest }) => (
  <div {...substyle(rest, { '&disabled': disabled })}>
    <div {...substyle(rest, { bar: true, '&disabled': disabled })} />
  </div>
)

<Foo className='foo' />                   // <div class='foo'>
                                          //   <div className='foo__bar' />
                                          // </div>

<Foo className='foo' disabled />          // <div class='foo foo--disabled'>
                                          //   <div className='foo__bar' />
                                          // </div>
const style = {                             
  position: 'absolute',                 
  top: 0,                               
                                        
  bar: { width: '100%' },                 // 'bar' element base styles
  
  '&disabled': {                          // nested styles for the '&disabled' modifier:
    opacity: 0.5,                         //  - direct styles to be set on the container
    bar: { width: '50%' },                //  - 'bar' element styles to be merged with base styles
  }
}

                                          // <div style='position: absolute; top: 0;'>
<Foo style={style} />                     //   <div style='width: 100%' /> 
                                          // </div>  

                                          // <div style='position: absolute; top: 0; opacity: 0.5;'>
<Foo style={style} disabled />            //   <div style='width: 50%' /> 
                                          // </div>  
```


### Chaining & default styles

Every *substyle* call return a new instance of the *substyle* function which is preconfigured to use
the styles selected in the previous call as a default. The `style` prop passed in the chained 
*substyle* call will be merged with the default styles 
(using lodash's [merge](https://lodash.com/docs#merge) function).

TODO

```javascript
import substyle from 'substyle'

// create preconfigured substyle
const mySubstyle = substyle({
  position: 'relative',
  foo: {
    position: 'absolute'
  }
})
```

### Selector function for modifier keys

TODO

TODO: Also point out the possibility to bind derived substyle in render function

```
const substyleForMyComp = substyle(
  { style: defaultStyles },
  (props) => ({ '&disabled': props.readOnly })
)

const boundSubstyleForMyComp = elementKey => substyleForMyComp.bind(null, this.props)
<div {...boundSubstyleForMyComp('myEl')} />
```


### css modules

TODO

implementation ideas:

- let users pass a `classNames` containing a nested object mapping element / modifier keys to generated css module class names
- OR only derive a unique block class names via automatically and derive all element class names the same way as now (requires a custom generateScopedName function passed with the postcss options)


### css in JS

TODO

implementation ideas:

- add option to hook in 'transform' functions that take the selected inline style definitions and can turn them into css, e.g., by using aphrodite's StyleSheet.create or some wrapper around react-css

## Real world examples

If you want to see how _substyle_ is used in practice, go have a look at code of existing React components already using it:
